What if we could build collaborative applications where the users own their data and can decide what is done with it? Apps that work offline and load faster than any server could deliver them? What if they are also easier to create and run for developers without the need for complicated cloud deployments?

This is where local-first software comes in. On January 11th and 12th 2025 [feathers.dev](https://feathers.dev) will be co-hosting the [DWeb Local First weekend](https://lu.ma/2ul5uwdl), a weekend of shared learning and coding at [Z Space](https://z-space.ca/) in Vancouver together with [Hypha](https://hypha.coop/) and [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/).

It will be a weekend of exploring the emerging technologies and principles of this new kind of software. We'll learn about the broader [DWeb movement](https://getdweb.net/), local-first technologies we can use right now and hack on some projects.

We'll kick things off on Saturday with three great talks:

- **An introduction to local-first software** by [Peter Van Hardenberg](https://www.inkandswitch.com/)
- **Local-First Access Control: Trust and Security Without Boundaries** by [Brooke Zelenka](https://notes.brooklynzelenka.com/)
- **Building real-time apps without the Cloud** by [David Luecke](https://bsky.app/profile/daffl.me)

I briefly demoed a [local-first chat application](https://dwebchat.feathers.dev/) at the [DWeb Seattle social](https://dwebyvr.org/dweb-seattle-social-trip-report/) and will expand on it in my talk:

Afterwards we will hang out at the Z Space to shack on projects and listen to music and reconvene on Sunday for brunch and sharing our learnings and findings.

You can read the [foundational essay from Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/?ref=dwebyvr.org) and watch the [talks from the Local-First Conf in Berlin in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/@localfirstconf) to learn more about local-first software.
